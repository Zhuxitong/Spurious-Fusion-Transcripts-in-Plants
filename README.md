# Custom Scripts for "The Hidden Sources of Spurious Fusion Transcripts in Plants"

This repository contains the custom scripts developed for the study: **"The Hidden Sources of Spurious Fusion Transcripts in Plants"**. 

These tools are specifically designed to address the challenges of identifying and validating fusion transcripts in plants, with a focus on distinguishing true biological fusions from technical artifacts.

## 📁 Repository Contents

The scripts include:

### 1. Plant Fusion Detection
* **Modified JAFFAL:** A customized version of the [JAFFAL](https://github.com/Oshlack/JAFFA) software. Modifications were implemented to improve compatibility with complex plant genomes and non-standard gene annotations.
* **Arriba-based Pipeline:** Commands for identifying fusion transcripts from short-read RNA-seq data using the Arriba framework.
* **Hybrid-Specific Identification:** Specialized scripts for detecting fusion transcripts within hybrid rice.

### 2. Classification & Breakpoint Analysis
* **Breakpoint Categorization:** Scripts for the classification of fusion breakpoints based on genomic context.

### 3. Visualization Tools
* **IGV:** Custom scripts for generating Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) screenshots of fusions and their breakpoints.

### 4. Network Analysis
* **MH63 Draft Assembly:** Commands used for the draft MH63 assembly.
* **Network Analysis:** Scripts for performing network-based analyses to identify modules and patterns within the false-positive fusions.

### 5. Statistics and Plotting
* **Quantitative Analysis:** R scripts for statistical tests and data processing described in the manuscript.
* **Publication Figures:** Custom plotting scripts used to generate manuscript figures.
